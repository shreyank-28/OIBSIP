I have completed my Data Analytics Internship, where I have successfully tackled four projects, each offering unique insights and challenges. 
The first project involved conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data, allowing me to uncover trends and patterns in consumer behavior.
Next, I worked on a Sentiment Analysis project, which enabled me to analyze public opinion on various topics through social media data. 
I also delved into Predicting House Prices using Linear Regression, honing my skills in predictive modeling.
Lastly, I explored the Android App Market, aiming to unveil key factors influencing app success. 
Each project has significantly enhanced my analytical skills and deepened my understanding of data-driven decision-making.
